# Mushroom-classification
## Can we classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous using ML techniques?

We first started with exploratory data analysis to check for imbalances in the data, before preprocessing and training classifier models including a Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. We evaluated feature importance in the RF model and performed appropriate hyperparamater tuning. For clustering analysis, we used dimensionality reduction methods like PCA, K-Means with PCA, and K-Means with t-SNE.
